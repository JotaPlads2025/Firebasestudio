## Core Features:

- Professional Profile Creation: Enable instructors to create a comprehensive professional profile highlighting their expertise and certifications. Ensure the profile is trustworthy and that prospective students find what they're looking for. The tool will try different formulations and layouts to make it stand out to prospective students, and ask for the instructor's permission to use them.
- Class Creation and Management: Allow instructors to create and manage their classes with detailed descriptions, scheduling, pricing, and availability. Ensure instructors have a complete overview of active vs. inactive classes.
- Performance Dashboard: Provide a dashboard displaying key metrics such as bookings, attendance, revenue, and student demographics to help instructors track their business performance. The dashboard also breaks the stats by class, to give the instructor ideas on how to tweak class format or scheduling for better performance.
