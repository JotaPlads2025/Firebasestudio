/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Avanzamos application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data
 * (users, instructor profiles, and notifications). Classes are owned by instructors,
 * and bookings are associated with both classes and students. The rules prioritize
 * authorization independence by denormalizing authorization-relevant data (e.g.,
 * instructorId in Class documents, studentId in Booking documents) directly onto the
 * documents being secured.  This avoids the need for costly and slow `get()` calls
 * in the security rules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user information.
 * - /users/{userId}/instructorProfile: Stores instructor-specific profile information.
 * - /instructors/{instructorId}/classes/{classId}: Stores class information, nested under the instructor.
 * - /classes/{classId}/bookings/{bookingId}: Stores booking information for each class.
 * - /users/{userId}/notifications/{notificationId}: Stores user-specific notifications.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data (user documents, instructor profiles, notifications).
 * - Instructors can manage (create, update, delete) their own classes.
 * - Students can only create bookings for themselves.
 * - Listing operations are generally restricted to owners (e.g., users listing their own notifications, instructors listing their own classes).
 * - Data validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping, focusing primarily on
 *   ownership and relational integrity checks.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Class` entity includes `instructorId`, allowing rules to validate instructor ownership without extra reads.
 * - The `Booking` document includes `studentId` to enable rules to verify user booking and attendance.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Classes are stored under instructors, and notifications are stored under users,
 *   providing clear ownership and simplifying list operations.
